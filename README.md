# hello-world
First repository

Ok, now I start to understand what do really makes Git and what do really help GitHub.

## Setup Environment

To set up the environment for this project, run the `install.sh` script. This script will install all the necessary dependencies and create a build directory.

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

## Build Project
```bash
chmod +x build.sh
./install.sh
```
